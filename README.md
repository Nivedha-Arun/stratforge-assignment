## Reflection

I have developed this application in 2.5 days and my main goal being able to give you an understanding about the knowledge I have in these technologies.

In the given time I was able to develop,

Home Screen with Menu's (History, Ships and Rockets)

![HomeScreen](/src/assets/spacex_logo.png)

Sub Pages for the Menu Items

Details Page for the selected record.


If I had additional time,

 I would have been able to develop the filter and sort functionality for the list. 
 
 Provided a better UI with animations and proper responsiveness
